# AccCreatorApp ![This is an image](Tibia_icon.png)

## This is second version of my Account Creator App

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ The program takes control of the keyboard and mouse. ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ##
⚠️ It is not recommended to use the mouse or enter text on the keyboard while the program is running. ⚠️

This version of the code is based on the Robot class

Without using external libraries

I am creating this program for people who like play in Tibia and often have to create new accounts :D 

## Only JDK installed on your computer is required for the program to work properly.
